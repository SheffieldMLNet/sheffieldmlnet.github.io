    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-francois-briol/"> Bayesian Quadrature for Multiple Related Integrals</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are a set of tools providing posterior distributions on the output of numerical methods. The use of these methods is usually motivated by the fact that they can represent our uncertainty due to incomplete/finite information about the continuous mathematical problem being approximated. In this talk, we demonstrate that this paradigm can provide additional advantages, such as the possibility of transferring information between several numerical methods.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract In this talk, we look at swarms of robots from two different perspectives. First, we consider the problem of designing behavioral rules of extreme simplicity. We show among others how &ldquo;computation-free&rdquo; robots, with only 1 bit or trit of sensory information, can accomplish tasks such as self-organized aggregation 1 or collective choice 2. Second, we consider the problem of inferring the behavioral rules or morphology of the individuals. We use Turing Learning 3 - a generalization of Generative Adversarial Networks 4.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-miguel-decarvalho/">On Some Geometrical Aspects of Bayesian Inference</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract In this talk I will provide a geometric interpretation to Bayesian inference that allows me to introduce a natural measure of the level of agreement between priors, likelihoods, and posteriors. The starting point for the construction of our geometry is the observation that the marginal likelihood can be regarded as an inner product between the prior and the likelihood. A key concept in our geometry is that of compatibility, a measure which is based on the same construction principles as Pearson correlation, but which can be used to assess how much the prior agrees with the likelihood, to gauge the sensitivity of the posterior to the prior, and to quantify the coherency of the opinions of two experts.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-andreas-damianou/">Probability and Uncertainty in Deep Learning</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract In this talk, I will motivate the need for introducing probabilistic and Bayesian flavour to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; deep learning approaches. For example, Bayesian treatment of neural network parameters is an elegant way of avoiding overfitting and heuristics in optimization, while providing a solid mathematical grounding. I will also highlight the deep Gaussian process family of approaches, which can be seen as non-parametric Bayesian neural networks. The Bayesian treatment of neural networks comes with mathematical intractabilities, therefore I will outline some of the approximate inference methods used to tackle these intractabilities.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-gedi-luksys/">Neuroinformatics of Learning, Memory and Decision Making: from Model-based Analyses to Individualized Cognitive Neurotherapeutics</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract How we learn, recall our memories, and use them for making decisions depend on our genes as well as on environmental modulators, such as stress, emotion and uncertainty. Cognitive performance is the outcome of several neurobiologically distinct mental processes, some of which are not easily amenable to direct observation. Their roles and interactions can, however, be dissociated with computational models. Using examples from animal learning under stress and imaging genetics of human memory, I will show how computational models can be used to discover neural and genetic correlates of cognitive phenomena, and suggest their computational explanations.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-leandro-minku/">Learning Non-Stationary Data Streams With Gradually Evolved Classes</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract In machine learning, class evolution is the phenomenon of class emergence and disappearance. It is likely to occur in many data stream problems, which are problems where additional training data become available over time. For example, in the problem of classifying tweets according to their topic, new topics may emerge over time, and certain topics may become unpopular and not discussed anymore. Therefore, class evolution is an important research topic in the area of learning data streams.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-rui-pontecosta/"> Cortical Microcircuits as Gated-Recurrent Neural Networks</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure suggests the existence of common computational principles. However, such principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks, namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), I will describe a recurrent neural network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-christopher-cox/">Mapping Neural Activity to Conceptual Structure with Regularized Regression</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract Concepts are integral to cognition and foundational to knowledge, but how concepts are represented in the brain is not well understood. Influential computational models of cognition have simulated how concepts develop and are utilized as distributed representations in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Distributed representation is also a principle at the core of contemporary deep-learning networks, which for example power today&rsquo;s most successful computer speech and image recognition models, and have achieved stunning feats like Google DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaGo teaching itself to play the board game Go so well that it consistently beats elite human players.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract Recent advances in application of machine learning to genomic scale data interpretation for drug repurposing have brought biotechnology and data science into stark relief. This sea change reflects the challenge and opportunities created by two behemoths which like galaxies, are slowly colliding. Organisations are waking up to the value of having information that comes from existing datasets, generating targeted data, and looking within it to drive insight, rather than establishing an hypothesis about a particular drug target/drug combination and finding anecdotal data to support or refute it.

    <h2><a href="https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/talk/seminar-wil-ward/">Fuzzy Rules for Recursive Bayesian Filtering in Multi-Process State Models</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Abstract Systems under the influence of uncertain dynamic processes can pose a distinct challenge for predictive estimators, especially in the case where there are multiple non-linear processes influencing the system state to varying degree. In a wide range of application domain problems, including sensing data and target tracking, there are complex system processes that occur simultaneously or consecutively at unknown intervals. The general case can by modelled using a Markov-switching state space model, where each SSM represents a process affecting the state.
