## Abstract
  
Watch live at [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/moritz-grosse-wentrups](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/moritz-grosse-wentrups).  
Brought to you with support from [World Wide Neuro](https://www.worldwideneuro.com) -- [Seminar listing](https://www.worldwideneuro.com/seminar-series.html?name=Sheffield_ML).  
  
Complex systems can be modeled at various levels of granularity, e.g., we can model a person at the cognitive level, on the neuronal level, or down to the biochemical level. When multiple models represent the same system at different scales, we would like to be able to reason about the causal effects of interventions on each level in such a way that the models remain consistent across levels. In the first part of this talk, I consider which conditions must be fulfilled for two structural equation models (SEMs) to stand in such a causally consistent relation. In the second part of the talk, I present recent work on learning causally consistent SEMs across multiple levels, distinguishing between bottom-up (micro- to macro-level) and top-down (macro- to micro-level) approaches.  
  
## Biography

From Prof Moritz Grosse-Wentrup's group website:  
  
The research group Neuroinformatics develops statistical models and machine learning methods that infer causal relations from purely observational data. We then use these methods to study how neural processes, e.g., as observed by calcium imaging, EEG, ECoG, or fMRI, generate cognition and behavior.  
  
An important aspect of our work is the translation of our insights into clinical applications, e.g., by designing brain-computer interfaces that assist paralyzed patients in communication, or by developing personalized brain stimulation protocols in the context of stroke rehabilitation.
