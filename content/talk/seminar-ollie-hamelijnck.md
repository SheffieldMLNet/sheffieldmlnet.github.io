Poor air quality in cities is a significant threat to health and life expectancy, with over 80% of people living in urban areas exposed to air quality levels that exceed World Health Organisation limits.  
  
In this session, I present a multi-resolution multi-task framework that handles evidence integration under varying spatio-temporal sampling resolution and noise levels. We have developed both shallow Gaussian Process (GP) mixture models and deep GP constructions that naturally handle this evidence integration, as well as biases in the mean. These models underpin our work at the Alan Turing Institute towards providing spatio-temporal forecasts of air pollution across London. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic examples and applications on London air quality.

## Biography

From Ollie Hamelijnck's website:  
  
Ollie is working on the Lloyds Registry Foundation funded London air quality project. Ollie was previously a student at the University of Warwick where he got a first class MEng in Computer Science. His 4th year thesis was on modelling air pollution in London. Ollie also spent three summers as a Software Engineer Intern at Modality Systems in which he was creating prototypes using new technologies, worked in testing and worked on their main products.
