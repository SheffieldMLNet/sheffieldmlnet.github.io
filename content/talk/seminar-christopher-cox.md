## Abstract

Concepts are integral to cognition and foundational to knowledge, but how concepts are represented in the brain is not well understood. Influential computational models of cognition have simulated how concepts develop and are utilized as distributed representations in artificial neural networks (ANNs). Distributed representation is also a principle at the core of contemporary deep-learning networks, which for example power today's most successful computer speech and image recognition models, and have achieved stunning feats like Google DeepMind's AlphaGo teaching itself to play the board game Go so well that it consistently beats elite human players. While ANNs are "neurally inspired", their usefulness as models of how brains actually represent knowledge is contested. I argue this is largely because neuroimaging data is typically explored in ways that are not sensitive to distributed representation, even if it does exist. I will present two techniques based on regularized linear regression that I am using to provide a fairer test of whether neural representations of concepts are distributed, in the ANN sense. These techniques are applied to neuroimaging datasets, yielding results which generally support the idea that distributed representation may be a useful analogue to concepts at the neural level, in addition to the cognitive level.

## Biography

Chris Cox received a PhD in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in December 2016, and is currently a post-doctoral researcher in the Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit at the University of Manchester. In the fall of 2018 he will begin a faculty position in the Psychology Department at Louisiana State University.

Dr Cox is a cognitive neuroscientist who studies how conceptual knowledge is learned, stored, and retrieved. This begins with asking questions about what representations are like, in the first place. Computational modelling provides the basis for forming hypotheses that attempt to resolve this basic question, and behavioural and neuroimaging experimentation provides a means for evaluating these hypotheses. A critical part of his research program relies on collaborations with engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists to develop and apply optimization routines and computational workflows that are sophisticated enough to test these hypotheses as well as currently possible.
