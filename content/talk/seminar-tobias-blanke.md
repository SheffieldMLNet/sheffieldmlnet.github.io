## Abstract

The talk will introduce some of Tobias’ work in artificial intelligence and big data. His current work firstly looks at the opportunities of AI technology to increase both the scope and complexity of researching human culture based on historical and born-digital sources. But his work also focuses on the epistemological implications of AI, including an understanding of its bias and how meaning develops through the eyes of a computer.
