## Abstract

Advances in deep generative models are at the forefront of deep learning 
research because of the promise they offer for allowing data-efficient 
learning, and for model-based reinforcement learning. In this talk I'll 
review the foundations of probabilistic reasoning and generative 
modeling. I will then introduce modern approximations which allow for 
efficient large-scale training of a wide variety of generative models, 
demonstrate a few applications of these models to density estimation, 
missing data imputation, data compression and planning. Finally, I will 
discuss some of the open problems in the field.

## Biography

Danilo Jimenez Rezende is a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind, 
working on general-purpose machine reasoning and learning algorithms. He 
holds a BA in Physics and MSc in Theoretical Physics from Ecole 
Polytechnique (Palaiseau – France) and from the Institute of Theoretical 
Physics (SP – Brazil) and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience at Ecole 
Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, EPFL (Lausanne – Switzerland). His 
research focuses on scalable inference methods, generative models of 
images and video, applied probability, Bayesian analysis and 
unsupervised (deep) learning.
