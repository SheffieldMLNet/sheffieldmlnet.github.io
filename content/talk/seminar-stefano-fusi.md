## Biography

From Prof Stefano Fusi's website:  
  
Stefano Fusi wants to design technology inspired by the human brain. As a step toward this goal, he is using math to better understand how the brain itself computes information, especially as related to problem solving, reasoning and decision-making. Because these brain-like machines would consume less electricity than today’s computers and be better at certain activities (such as recognizing images or driving cars), Dr. Fusi’s work could lead to technological advances that have thus far remained beyond our reach.
