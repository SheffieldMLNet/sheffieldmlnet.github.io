## Abstract

High throughput technologies have led to an increased availability of data and to the need for novel statistical tools. Biological networks provide a mathematical representation of patterns of interaction between appropriate biological elements. We propose a novel approach to compare community structures in different networks. During this seminar we will try to address some open questions: How can we compare two (or more) networks and their community structures? Can we use Network Enrichment Analysis tools to do this? Is it an advantage to integrate metadata to infer communities?
