## Abstract
How we learn, recall our memories, and use them for making decisions depend on our genes as well as on environmental modulators, such as stress, emotion and uncertainty. Cognitive performance is the outcome of several neurobiologically distinct mental processes, some of which are not easily amenable to direct observation. Their roles and interactions can, however, be dissociated with computational models. Using examples from animal learning under stress and imaging genetics of human memory, I will show how computational models can be used to discover neural and genetic correlates of cognitive phenomena, and suggest their computational explanations. I will also show how databases and multi-voxel pattern analyses can be used to inform and improve neuroimaging-based correlates of learning and memory, and discuss about ecological relevance of human experimental setups using schema-based learning and decision making as an example. Finally, I will propose applications of model-bases analyses and future directions in cognitive neuroinformatics, such as automated characterization of individual decision making profiles from big data and individualized cognitive neurotherapeutics.

## Biography
Gedi Luksys did his PhD in Computational & Behavioural Neuroscience at EPFL, Switzerland in 2009 and postdoc at University of Basel, Switzerland, working on human imaging genetics and model-based analysis of memory. In 2016 he started a lectureship at the University of Edinburgh.

His research explores several directions of computational cognitive neuroscience, such as modeling animal and human behaviour in various learning, memory and decision making setups, studying the role of schemas on learning and decision making as well as employing multi-voxel pattern analysis. He also investigates computational roles of stress and other modulators, how they interact with individual traits to control behaviour and cognition, and how they can be used to improve cognitive performance and alleviate adverse effects of mental disorders.
