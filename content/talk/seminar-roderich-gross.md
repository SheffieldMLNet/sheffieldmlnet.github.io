## Abstract

In this talk, we look at swarms of robots from two different perspectives. First, we consider the problem of designing behavioral rules of extreme simplicity. We show among others how "computation-free" robots, with only 1 bit or trit of sensory information, can accomplish tasks such as self-organized aggregation [^1] or collective choice [^2]. Second, we consider the problem of inferring the behavioral rules or morphology of the individuals. We use Turing Learning [^3] - a generalization of Generative Adversarial Networks [^4]. In Turing Learning, discriminators are allowed to "interrogate", similar to their human counterparts in the Turing test. We present two case studies where this active learning approach helps improve model accuracy.

## Biography

Roderich Gross is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield. He received a Ph.D. degree in engineering science in 2007 from Universit√© libre de Bruxelles in 2007, and was a JSPS Fellow (Tokyo Institute of Technology) and a Marie Curie Fellow (EPFL & Unilever). He has made contributions to the coordination of swarm and reconfigurable robots, and invented the Turing Learning method.
