## Abstract

We consider two problems in statistical machine learning -- an old and a new:

1. Given a machine learning task, what kinds of data distributions make it easier or harder? For instance, it is known that large margin makes classification tasks easier.
2. Given a high dimensional learning task, when can we solve it from a few random projections of the data with good-enough approximation? This is the compressed learning problem.

This talk will present results and work in progress that highlight parallels between these two problems. The implication is that random projection -- a simple and effective dimensionality reduction method with origins in theoretical computer science -- is not just a timely subject for efficient learning from large high dimensional data sets, but it can also help us make a previously elusive fundamental problem more approachable. On the flip side, the parallel allows us to broaden the guarantees that hold for compressed learning beyond of those initially inherited from compressed sensing.

## Biography

Ata Kaban is a senior lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham UK, and EPSRC Early Career Fellow. Her research interests include statistical machine learning and data mining in high dimensional data spaces, algorithmic learning theory, probabilistic modelling of data, and black-box optimisation. She authored / co-authored 80 peer-reviewed papers, including best paper awards at GECCO'13, ACML'13, ICPR'10, and a runner-up at CEC'15. She was recipient of an MRC Discipline Hopping award in 2008/09. She holds a PhD in Computer Science (2001) and a PhD in Musicology (1999). She is member of the IEEE CIS Technical Committee on Data Mining and Big Data Analytics, and vice-chair of the IEEE CIS Task Force on High Dimensional Data Mining.
