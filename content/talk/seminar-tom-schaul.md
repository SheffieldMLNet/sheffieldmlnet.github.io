## Abstract

Two desiderata for general intelligence are performance and generality. The first requires acting to achieve goals or solve problems; the second asks for agents that are competent on a diversity of tasks, or at least can learn to become so -- with minimal teaching signal, if possible. After decades of focus on performance, recent research has started to emphasize the aspect of generality, building on two key ingredients, namely reinforcement learning (RL) and deep neural networks. I will discuss some of their strengths and weaknesses, put recent breakthroughs into context (e.g. AlphaGo, DQN), and sketch outs some ongoing directions that could push generality even further.

## Biography

Tom Schaul is a senior researcher in reinforcement learning at DeepMind. He did his PhD with JÃ¼rgen  Schmidhuber at IDSIA and his Postdoc with Yann LeCun at NYU. He has published many areas of AI, including deep learning, optimization algorithms, artificial curiosity, evolutionary algorithms, and most recently on deep and hierarchical RL. He thinks that substantial progress on general AI is possible, and that games are perfect benchmark domains for that.
