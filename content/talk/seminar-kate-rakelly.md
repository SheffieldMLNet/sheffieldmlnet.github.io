While meta-learning algorithms are often viewed as algorithms that learn to learn, an alternative viewpoint frames meta-learning as inferring a hidden task variable from experience consisting of observations and rewards. From this perspective, learning to learn is learning to infer. This viewpoint can be useful in solving problems in meta-RL, which I’ll demonstrate through two examples: (1) enabling off-policy meta-learning, and (2) performing efficient meta-RL from image observations. I’ll also discuss how this perspective leads to an algorithm for few-shot image segmentation.  
      
## Biography

From Kate Rakelly's website:  
  
I am a PhD candidate in BAIR at UC Berkeley, where I am advised by Sergey Levine. During my PhD I've also worked with Alyosha Efros and Trevor Darrell.  
  
Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's in EECS from UC Berkeley, where I did undergraduate research with Shiry Ginosar and Alyosha Efros in computer vision as well as Insoon Yang and Claire Tomlin in control.
