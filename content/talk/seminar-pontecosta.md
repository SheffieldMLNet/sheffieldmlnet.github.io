## Abstract

Cortical circuits exhibit intricate recurrent architectures that are remarkably similar across different brain areas. Such stereotyped structure suggests the existence of common computational principles. However, such principles have remained largely elusive. Inspired by gated-memory networks, namely long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), I will describe a recurrent neural network in which information is gated through inhibitory cells that are subtractive (subLSTM). We propose a natural mapping of subLSTMs onto known canonical excitatory-inhibitory cortical microcircuits. Empirical evaluation across sequential image classification and language modelling tasks shows that subLSTM units can achieve similar performance to LSTM units. These results suggest that cortical circuits can be optimised to solve complex contextual problems and proposes a novel view on their computational function. Overall our work provides a step towards unifying recurrent networks as used in machine learning with their biological counterparts.

## Biography

I have a PhD in Computational Neuroscience & Machine Learning from the University of Edinburgh (2015), and did postdoctoral work at the University of Oxford (2014-2017; 2017- visiting researcher) in collaboration with theoretical, experimental and machine learning labs. Currently, I am a postdoc at University of Bern trying to teach recurrent cortical microcircuits.

My research focuses on the development of statistical and computational methods to better understand the principles that underlie intelligent behaviour. In particular, I develop unifying models of neural learning and networks grounded on experimental data, which shed light on how the brain solves complex computational problems and inspire novel machine learning algorithms.
