## Abstract

Originally purposed to streamline documentation of care, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a massive amount of diverse and readily available data that can be used to tackle important healthcare problems. Clinical phenotyping is one of them, which refers to identifying patient subgroups sharing common clinically meaningful characteristics. However, there are significant challenges in using EHR data to computationally tackle this problem, related to algorithmic scalability, model interpretability and the longitudinal nature of patient data. In this talk, we will present recent methodological developments in the area of tensor factorization which effectively tackle those challenges.

## Biography

Ioakeim (Kimis) Perros is a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, as a member of the Healthcare AI group. He is also pursuing a Ph.D. degree from the School of Computational Science & Engineering of Georgia Tech. His current research focus is on developing and applying tensor methods for healthcare applications and is more broadly interested in machine learning, numerical linear algebra and their impact on healthcare data analytics. Previous research experience includes internships at the Health Informatics Division of Weill Cornell Medicine and the RD&D Department of Sutter Health. He has published in top Data Mining (KDD, SDM, ICDM) and co-authored papers in top Machine Learning (NIPS) and High-Performance Computing (SC, IPDPS) venues.
