Climate change is one of our generation's greatest challenges, with increasingly severe consequences on global ecosystems and populations. Machine Learning has the potential to address many important challenges in climate change, from both mitigation (reducing its extent) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable consequences) aspects. To present the extent of these opportunities, I will describe some of the projects that I am involved in, spanning from generative model to computer vision and natural language processing. There are many opportunities for fundamental innovation in this field, advancing the state-of-the-art in Machine Learning while ensuring that this fundamental progress translates into positive real-world impact.  
  
## Biography

From Sasha Luccioni's website:  
  
"""I am currently a post-doctoral IVADO fellow at University of Montreal and Mila (Quebec Institute for Learning Algorithms), working with Yoshua Bengio on how to use AI to fight climate change.  
  
In my previous studies and research, I have worked on various domains, namely Natural Language Processing and AI in Education (AIED).  
  
I care deeply about the state of our planet and hope to witness and participate in the positive changes required to save it in the coming years!"""
