In 2015, the United Nations (UN) proposed the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by all UN member states as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure global peace and prosperity. At the heart of this endeavor are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provide a blueprint to achieve this agenda, targeting objectives such as ensuring high-quality education, maximizing health and well-being, and taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. New technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been increasingly used to meet different SDGs, with breakthroughs in tasks such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) serving as important tools to achieve positive social impact. My research agenda builds on the existing applications of AI and ML in education, humanitarian response and the environment to have a positive impact on society. I will present some of the projects that I am working on, and propose ways to contribute towards using AI to achieve social good.    
  
## Biography

From Sasha Luccioni's website:  
  
"""I am currently a post-doctoral IVADO fellow at University of Montreal and Mila (Quebec Institute for Learning Algorithms), working with Yoshua Bengio on how to use AI to fight climate change.  
  
In my previous studies and research, I have worked on various domains, namely Natural Language Processing and AI in Education (AIED).  
  
I care deeply about the state of our planet and hope to witness and participate in the positive changes required to save it in the coming years!"""
