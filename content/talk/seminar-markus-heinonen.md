## Abstract
Deep learning commonly consist of successive sequence of transformations. We propose a novel deep learning paradigm of learning continuous-time transformations of the data instead of learning a discrete sequence of layers. The proposed differential Gaussian process flow consists of a stochastic differential equation to flow the inputs prior to a standard classification or regression function. The key property of differential GPs is the warping of inputs through infinitely deep, but infinitesimal, differential fields. This approach generalises classic deep neural networks into stochastic dynamical computation systems, and turns the focus from learning iterative function mappings to learning input representation flows in the original feature space, avoiding learning new feature spaces. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results that exceed the performance of deep Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks.

## Biography

Dr. Markus Heinonen is an Academy of Finland postdoctoral fellow at Aalto University, where he works on Bayesian deep learning. His recent works include (1) nonparametric Gaussian process differential equations and deep Gaussian processes, (2) non-stationary and latent GP mixture models, and (3) development of Fourier foundations of Gaussian processes. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science in 2013 from University of Helsinki. He then moved to France for a postdoc at TeleCom ParisTech before joining Aalto University in 2015.
