## Abstract

Location-based services such as augmented reality benefit greatly from accurate position estimates. In outdoor environments, global navigation satellite systems often offer adequate performance for a broad range of applications. However, performance of these systems degrades quickly when moving to the indoors due to the complex building structures affecting the satellite signals. Additionally, in indoor environments, an error of only a few meters can be the difference between two rooms or even floors. In this talk, we will discuss an alternative localization approach based on fingerprint maps of radio signals. The method uses Gaussian processes to model the radio landscape and can be used with, for example, WiFi or Bluetooth signals.

## Biography

Roland Hostettler received the Dipl. Ing. degree in electrical and communication engineering from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and Ph.D. in automatic control from Luleå University of Technology, Sweden in 2009 and 2014, respectively. From October 2014 to January 2016, he was a research associate at the Control Engineering Group at Luleå University of Technology. Since February 2016 he is a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation at Aalto University, Finland.
