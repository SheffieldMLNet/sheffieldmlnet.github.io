## Abstract

Recent technological advances in the high-throughput profiling of DNA, RNA and proteins in human tissue have lead to a wealth of genomic data and better understanding of complex diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and neuro-degeneration. This, however, has also lead to two major computational challenges of classification and feature selection. In this talk, He will highlight examples where supervised and unsupervised clustering approaches have been applied by drug developers aiming to produce "personalized" medicines from genomic data. He will also point out further machine learning problems and areas for collaboration with Sheffield's medical and biological research communities who are dealing with increasing amounts of genomic data.

## Biography

Dr Dennis Wang graduated from the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) and completed my undergrad dissertation at the European Bioinformatics Institute (Cambridge, UK). He then moved to the University of Cambridge for an MPhil working on boolean networks with Dr. Jasmin Fisher and Dr. Andrew Phillips (Microsoft Research), and a PhD working on statistical genetics with Prof Lorenz Wernisch and Prof Willem Ouwehand (MRC Biostatistics Unit).

Following the completion of my PhD in 2012, he undertook postdoctoral training to build a genomics core and identify biomarkers at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto, Canada) with Prof Ming-Sound Tsao and Prof Frances Shepherd. He was promoted to a staff scientist in 2013 to coordinate the genomic profiling and bioinformatics analysis of patient tumors. With a greater interest in drug development, he went back to Cambridge in 2014 to join the early drug discovery division of AstraZeneca where he developed computational methods to identify pharmacological biomarkers that predict drug response. He joined the University of Sheffield in 2016 as a lecturer to further establish genomics and bioinformatics as cornerstones within the education and research program at the medical school.
