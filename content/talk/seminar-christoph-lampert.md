## Biography

From Prof Christoph Lampert's lab webpage:  
  
Christoph Lampert received the PhD degree in mathematics from the University of Bonn in 2003. In 2010 he joined the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (IST Austria) first as an Assistant Professor and since 2015 as a Professor. There, he leads the research group for Machine Learning and Computer Vision, and since 2019 he is also the head of IST Austria's ELLIS unit. His research on computer vision and machine learning has won international and national awards, including a best paper prize at CVPR 2008. In 2012 he was awarded an ERC Starting Grant (consolidator phase) by the European Research Council. He currently is an Editor of the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), Action Editor of the Journal for Machine Learning Research (JMLR), and Associate Editor in Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).
