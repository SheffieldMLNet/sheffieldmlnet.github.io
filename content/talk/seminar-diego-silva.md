## Abstract

In this seminar, we will address the music data science, an application domain in significant growth in recent years. With the increasing maturity and availability of streaming platforms and technologies for music dissemination, computational tasks are increasingly needed in this domain. Examples of these tasks include genre and emotion classification, plagiarism identification, recommendation systems, visualization, and automatic playlist generation. From a data mining and machine learning perspective, this is a particularly challenging domain, as the related data is complex and heterogeneous, such as audio recordings, song lyrics, consumer comments and likes, album covers, artists' pictures, experts' reviews, among others. Considering this scenario, we will present techniques that can handle this kind of problem and discuss current ideas in development in our research lab.
