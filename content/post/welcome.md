Introducing the new _Machine Learning Research Network_: a forum for connecting researchers and students working in or with machine learning at the University of Sheffield, to provide a support network and foster collaboration.

In the past decade, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become the tools used at the forefront of data science. The growth of machine learning as a tool for abstraction and automation has inspired their application to a wide range of research areas. For example, neuroscience has long been an inspiration for both methodology and applications of machine learning.[^Hassabis2017] Other research areas where machine learning has been a key contributor are Natural Language Processing, and Speech and Hearing technologies.  Tandem increases in computational capacity and the availability of large data sets has given rise to significant interest in machine learning to make accurate predictions and identify patterns where manual abstraction is hard or impossible. With big data and trained methods, however, comes a great deal of uncertainty. Methods and techniques within machine learning that encapsulate this uncertainty can be used to infer and predict plausible patterns with quantifiable confidence.[^Ghahramani2015]

Machine learning as a tool is something that is becoming more and more widely used within the University of Sheffield, and AI innovations have be highlighted for increased investment by Research Councils UK.[^RCUK] The University of Sheffield in particular has been identified as a potential national centre for machine learning and artificial intelligence.[^MadeSmarter] The [Machine Learning group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning) in the Department of Computer Science has long been involved in research and providing support with machine learning, both within the group and beyond . We have developed the _Machine Learning Research Network_ to provide a forum for the group to provide this support across disciplines within the university. The network is open to anybody in the university, staff and students alike, and will provide support and resources to those from a spectrum of backgrounds.

The Machine Learning Research Network will host a collection of regular events, including the _Machine Learning Seminar Series_, and a fortnightly book club. We will also host distinguished speakers from prestigious institutes and industries for one-off events. These events will be free and open to the public, serving to engage students, academics and the public with machine learning at the University of Sheffield. We will also host a series of research forums and showcases, to bring together researcher with particular problems or data with those working in machine learning. These events will be the core manifestation of the ethic of the network: support research with machine learning, and to foster collaboration.

The philosophy encompassed by the network and in its events is to bring together the research community; to share resources and knowledge; and to promote dialogue on topics and applications in machine learning. If you would like to get involved with the Machine Learning Research Network, please attend any of our [events](/talk), including the [book club](/bookclub) and seminar series. You can also contact us by [email](mailto:mlnet@sheffield.ac.uk), join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/mlnet-group/join), and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sheffieldmlnet). Over the coming months, we will promote more speakers, research forums. Researchers and students from the Machine Learning group will also contribute regularly to this blog, with tips and topics to support those learning and working with machine learning.
