## About
The Open Data Science Initiative aims to bring the philosophy of sharing and community resource assimilation that underpins the success of the open source software movement to the area of research software to capitalise on underlying social driver that many talented people would like to see their ideas and work being applied for the widest benefit possible.

- Make new analysis methodologies available as widely and rapidly as possible with as few conditions on their use as possible.
- Educate our commercial, scientific and medical partners in the use of these latest methodologies
- Act to achieve a balance between data sharing for societal benefit and the right of an individual to own their data.

## Background
The challenges for data science arise because key entities are isolated from one another: methodology developers, methodology consumers, scientists, research software engineers.

A nice way to visualise isolated entities is as islands. And the key objective of open data science is to bridge between those islands. Islands represent users, data analysts and data scientists.

The principle of the Open Data Science Initiative is that no one should be unwillingly isolated, but just like the Keys, we need to appreciate that each island is a delicate ecosystem on its own, and that our bridging should not be damaging what already exists, but enhancing it.

## Software
Open data science is not just about open source software, being exclusively open source can even be damaging to the agenda, because it prevents delivery of solutions to those who most need them. Even if we feel a particular software choice (such as Excel) is detrimental to long term understanding of data, it is important to bridge to its users to ensure that our solutions cater for their needs.
