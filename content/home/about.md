The *Machine Learning Research Network* is a forum for researchers working with machine learning based at the University of Sheffield. Coordinated by the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning group</a> in the Department of Computer Science, with support from the <a href="http://statistics.group.shef.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Statistics group</a> in School of Mathematics and Statistics, we host a series of activities and events that fall under the umbrella of the network. These include a regular seminar series, a fortnightly book club. We will host special speakers, code caf√©s and collaborative forums, alongside other resources including a blog series and software examples.

The aim of the network is to promote collaboration and to provide support for researchers and students who are working with or have interest in machine learning topics. We also promote the <a href="http://opendsi.cc" target="_blank">Open Data Science Initiative</a> and the philosophy of resource sharing in the research community, particularly research software.

The research network is open to anyone within the university, and aims to be foster an accessible environment. If you would like to get involved with the network, you can come along to any of the activities we host, or get in touch.
