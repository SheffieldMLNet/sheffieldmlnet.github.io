The book club was run by postdocs and PhD students from the Machine Learning group in the Department of Computer Science. In each session, the group went through around twenty pages of an influential book in machine learning. The session was led by a volunteer who went through the contents and there wass open discussion on the theory and topic in depth.

We have now ceased with the book club in its current form. However, we will soon be initiating a tutorial series in its place, that will be co-organised by some PhD students. This will be announced shortly.
