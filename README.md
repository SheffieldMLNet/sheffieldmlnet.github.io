# About the network

The Machine Learning Research Network is a forum for ML researchers, based at the University of Sheffield. 

Coordinated by the [Machine Learning group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/machine-learning) in the Department of Computer Science, with support from the Statistics group in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, we host a series of activities and events. 

The aim of the network is to promote collaboration and to provide support for researchers and students who are working with or have interest in machine learning topics. We also promote the [Open Data Science Initiative](http://opendsi.cc/) and the philosophy of resource sharing in the research community, particularly research software.

<b><a href="https://inverseprobability.com/">Neil Lawrence</a></b> is coming to speak on the <b>17th June</b>:

Title: Understanding Artificial Intelligence [TBC]<br/>
Where: Diamond, DIA - Lecture Theatre 3<br/>
Date: Friday, 17th June, 2022<br/>
Time: Pre-talk drinks/food 16:30-17:00; Talk 17:00-18:00; Drinks/food following talk 18:00-18:30.<br/>
 
Abstract: TBC
 
Neil previously was Professor of machine learning here in Sheffield. He continued to develop applied probabilistic machine learning while director of machine learning at Amazon in Cambridge. Then, in 2019, Neil was appointed as the inaugural DeepMind Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge.
 
 <b>Mini poster session</b>
 
If you're working in the field of ML (in particular early careers, or PhD, MSc) we'd be very happy to have your posters up before/after the talk.
